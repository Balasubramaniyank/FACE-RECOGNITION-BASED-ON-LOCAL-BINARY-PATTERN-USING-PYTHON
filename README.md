# FACE-RECOGNITION-BASED-ON-LOCAL-BINARY-PATTERN-USING-PYTHON
This project proposes a face recognition system based on a Local Binary Pattern. Humans are able to share multiple emotions and feelings through their facial gestures and body language. In this project, in order to detect the emotions from the human face gesture, we use the complex process of explicit feature extraction in traditional face expression recognition and a face expression recognition method based on image edge detection. The facial expression image is normalized, and the edge of each layer of the image is extracted in the convolution process. With the help of a local binary pattern and a convolution neural network, we will be able to automatically detect the face recognition of human emotions. The classifier module is comprised of a global average pooling and softmax layer to calculate the probability of each class. The overall design optimizes the network parameters and maintains classification accuracy. This project is implemented using Python.
